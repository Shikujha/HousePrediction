# House-Price-Prediction
This project is based on Data Ananlysis and Machine Learning(Linear Regression) to predict the House price on the basis of previous data. 
# Steps
0)Data Analysis
  a)Insights/overview of data.
  b)Correlation between data.
  c)Data missing or not.
  d)Graph plotting.
1)Finding the types of model to be use according to question requirement.
  a)Supervised,Unsupervised or Reinforcement learning ?
  b)Classification task or regression task ?
  c)Batch learning or Online learning ?
Here, Supervised regression technique is used.
2)selecting performence measure(Evaluating the model).
   a)RMSE,MAE etc
Here, RMSE is used.
3)Launching the model.
